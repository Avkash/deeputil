# deeputil : GPU supported Deep Learning Utilities

## Image Classification Utilities

 - Ability to load VGG16, VGG19, resnet50, inception-v3, xception and pedict images from any of these models
 - Ability to extract featuers at any layer and any given featuremap from select layer
 - Understand the progression of learning into each network
 - Just 1 line image classifier based on pre-built network
 - Ability to add your own network and perform classification
 - Ability to use a pre-trained network and train with new images and use for classification
